            <br>
            <h1 style="color: #DB2124"><b>Sepore14 is the 14th iteration of Sepore (obviously), the most recent of the iterations, as well as the most well known to the public. He is characterized as overzealous and cocky, with a load of stupidity, and a hint of excellence. 014 is generally described by the public as an asshole, an idiot, or (rarely) misunderstood. While he has openly acknowledged these descriptions to be true in certain scenarios, he is typically indifferent towards these adjectives to his character. Sepore14 always pushes for what's important in any given circumstance, often times disregarding others' opinions on the matter. He is truly indifferent towards the world and its problems, only caring in the slightest if it has any effect on him or his sympathies. Compared to other Sepores, 014 has spoken of himself as 'inconsistent' as opposed to the rest.</b></h1>

            <h1 style="color: #9144AB"><b>Sepore13 is the 13th iteration of Sepore, and as opposed to Sepore14, 013 is the least known iteration to the public. This unknowablity of 013's character stems from its nature, hiding about, emulating its obscurity, and simply watching time pass. 013 is said to be careless and inefficient. This is shown by 013's inclination to skip August Conferences. Due to the proficiency of this stunt, 013 is often called for audiences with the Overseer. 013 is known to be quite skittish around others, reason likely being its seclusional lifestyle. Regardless of these little flaws, 013 is generally described by other iterations as friendly and willing to fight for its friends in a time of desperation.</b></h1>

            <h1 style="color: #182ECB"><b>Sepore12 is the 12th iteration of Sepore, and is the jokester of the iterations. 012 is commonly known to the public as the second to Sepore14, almost living in his shadow (though 012 denies this). 012 is described among the iterations as the nuisance, the prankster, the fucking idiot, etc. Although the iterations are hard on 012 for being such a nuisance, "he is just as much family as the next moron" according to the latter. 012 is also known to eat inedible objects such as pencil erasers, paper, and play-doh (he's actually ingested all of these objects before). Despite being considered a second to 014, he has been told to bring his own qualities to the iterations and was even an iteration before 014.</b></h1>

Although friendly to the public, 011 doesn't speak, only choosing to around other iterations. The other iterations characterize 011 as silent, unless spoken to (by other iterations). All while not speaking a single word, 011 has helped many people in need of assistance, even choosing to donate to children's hospitals every year. This work towards society has earned 011 an irredeemable respect, by both the iterations and the public.</b></h1>
